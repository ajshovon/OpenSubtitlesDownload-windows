## Introduction

**OpenSubtitlesDownload.py** is a small software written in Python, built to help you **quickly find and download subtitles** for your favorite videos. It can be used as a nautilus script, or as a regular application working under GNOME or KDE desktop environments. You can also use it in full CLI mode (Command Line Interface) on your NAS, Raspberry Pi or anywhere you want really, as long as you have a working Python interpreter.

The subtitles search is done by precisely **identifying your video files** by computing unique movie hash sums. This way, you have more chance to find a subtitles that is an **exact match** for your video files, avoiding synchronization problems between the subtitles and the soundtrack. But what if that doesn't work? Well, a search with the filename will be performed, but be aware: results are a bit more... unpredictable (don't worry, you will be warned! and you can even disable this feature if you want).

The subtitles search and download service is powered by [opensubtitles.com](https://www.opensubtitles.com). Big thanks to their hard work on this amazing project! Be sure to [give them your support](https://www.opensubtitles.com/en/users/vip) if you appreciate the service provided, they sure need donations for handling the ever growing hosting costs!

> OpenSubtitlesDownload v6 use the new REST API from the [opensubtitles.com](https://www.opensubtitles.com) website

> A valid account from [opensubtitles.com](https://www.opensubtitles.com) is still **REQUIRED**

### Features

- Use a GNOME/GTK or KDE/Qt GUI depending on your favorite desktop environment
- Or just use the CLI! Great for automation, and it works on Linux, macOS and Windows
- Query subtitles in more than 60 different languages for documentaries, movies, TV shows and more...
- Query subtitles in multiple languages at once
- Query subtitles for multiple video files and folders at once
- Detect valid video files (using mime types and file extensions)
- Detect correct video titles by computing unique movie hash sums in order to download the right subtitles for the right file!
- If the video detection fails, a backup search using filename is performed
- Download subtitles automatically if only one is available, choose the one you want otherwise
- Download the subtitles file right next to the video file (need read/write permissions)
- Rename downloaded subtitles to match the video file. Possibility to add a language code (ex: movie_en.srt).

## Installation

#### Requirements

- Python 3
- zenity (only needed for GNOME based desktop environments)
- kdialog (only needed for KDE based desktop environments)
- Common unix tools (only needed for GUIs): wget, ps & grep (GUI autodetection)

#### Quick installation (nautilus script, with GNOME desktop environment)

For more installation options, check [the wiki](https://github.com/emericg/OpenSubtitlesDownload/wiki#installation-1)!

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/
$ cd ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emericg/OpenSubtitlesDownload/master/OpenSubtitlesDownload.py
$ chmod u+x OpenSubtitlesDownload.py
```

#### IMPORTANT STEP: use an opensubtitles.com account!

To use OpenSubtitlesDownload you need to:

- [Create an account](https://www.opensubtitles.com/) on opensubtitles.com website
- [Use that account](https://github.com/emericg/OpenSubtitlesDownload/wiki/Adjust-settings#log-in-with-a-registered-user) with the script

The old opensubtitles.ORG accounts won't work anymore (unless you migrated them from the new website).

## Screenshots!

Start the search with a simple right click on a video file.
